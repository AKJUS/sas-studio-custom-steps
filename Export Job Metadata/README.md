# Extract Job Metadata

The **Extract Job Metadata** custom step helps you to extract all content (SAS Code, HTML forms, XML Prompts and Parameters) from a SAS Job Execution Engine Job (often just called SAS Job). The extracted content is stored in SAS Server.

If you want to leverage the additional integration with Git you can use the Git Repositories pane in SAS Studio or the Git Custom Step, refer this [page](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-studio-custom-steps/blob/main/Git%20-%20Clone%20Git%20Repo/Overview%20of%20Git-related%20Custom%20Steps.md) which explains the motivation behind custom steps which surface Git integration functionality.

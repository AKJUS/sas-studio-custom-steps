# DQ - Cluster Analysis #

## Description ##
The Cluster Analysis step enables you can compare pairs of rows within a single match cluster to determine whether each pair is really a match. This step helps you to score each record in a cluster to determine if a record in a cluster is a potential false positive or not.

* You can either run rules and set an individual score for each rule condition or
* You can use the rules to determine if a cluster rule was triggered for a record to match a cluster.

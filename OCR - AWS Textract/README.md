# OCR - AWS Textract

## Description

This custom step uses the AWS Textract](https://aws.amazon.com/textract/) service to perform different types of [OCR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) on files that can be stored in S3 buckets or on the SAS Compute file system.


### Features
- Text Extraction (Words / Lines / Paragraphs / Pages)
- Form Extraction (Key-Value)
- Supports: Local Files (SAS Viya) & Files in S3 Bucket

> **Note:** This step works well with the following custom step [Create Listings of Directory - CLOD](https://github.com/sassoftware/sas-studio-custom-steps/tree/main/Create%20Listing%20of%20Directory%20CLOD) to create the input file-list based on a folder of documents. 

### Testdata
Here is a list of test documents
